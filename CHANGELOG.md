# Changes

This log documents significant changes for each release.

## [1.0.845] - 2023-01-07

* Fix and speed-up `get-refset-members'
* More complete unit testing
* Add support for module dependency reference set items
* Flag any module dependency problems on indexing and serve
* Report size of search indices in status report
* Use language preferences for fully specified name


## [1.0.822] - 2022-12-24

* Enable native support for Apple Silicon, rather than needing to use an x86-64 JDK. (To add native aarm64 support, you will need to manually build lmdb binary - see README).
* Log detailed system information on server startup, including architecture.

## [1.0.815] - 2022-12-22

* Upgrade to netty-buffer 4.1.86
* Improve namespace stratification by factoring out common Lucene functions shared by the two indices (descriptions and refset members).
* Move ECL and CG implementations into `com.eldrix.hermes.impl` as they contain no public-facing API.
* Explicitly use an opaque handle for core API to represent encapsulated runtime state. The prior public but undocumented `Service` is now deprecated in favour of a private `Svc` with `hermes/open` returning `Closeable`.   

## [1.0.804] - 2022-11-27

* Upgrade to Lucene 9.4.2 (and Lucene 8.11.2 when java 8 compatibility required)

* Add `get-description` and `get-relationship` to top-level API
* Add polymorphic `get-component` via graph API
* Add additional reference set item resolution via graph API
* Address miscellaneous code linting (removal unused imports and requires, avoid shadowing vars, improved comments / docstrings) 

## [1.0.772] - 2022-11-08

* Tweak indexing so that reference set items are indexed in a separate pass as
an interim step during import, for refset reification, and then re-indexed in 
the formal 'index' step.
* Update documentation to recommend compaction should be run *after* indexing, now
that the core datastore is updated during indexing.

## [1.0.770] - 2022-11-07

* Fix [#42](https://github.com/wardle/hermes/issues/42) in which relationship indices could be incorrect if
more than one relationship in a distribution relates to the same source-target-type tuple.
* Add `intersect-ecl` to core library to intersect a set of concept identifiers with an ECL expression.
